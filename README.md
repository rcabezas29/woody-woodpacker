# woody-woodpacker
ELF Pakcer

## Overview
Woody Woodpacker is a simple packer for 64-bit ELF binaries. This project encrypts an executable and produces a new binary that decrypts itself upon execution, ensuring its behavior remains identical to the original.

## Features
- Encrypts 64-bit ELF executables using a key-based XOR algorithm.
- The encryption key is either autogenerated (64 bytes long) or specified using the `-p` flag.
- Utilizes the `PT_NOTE` to `PT_LOAD` technique for memory manipulation.
- The encrypted binary displays `....WOODY....` before executing the payload that decripts itself in runtime.
- Maintains the integrity and execution flow of the original binary.

## Usage
### Compilation
Ensure you have a working C compiler, `nasm` and necessary dependencies, then compile using:
```sh
make
```

### Running the Packer
```sh
./woody_woodpacker <target_binary>

> key_value:
```

This generates a new executable named `woody`.

### Running the Encrypted Binary
```sh
./woody
```

Specify key:
```sh
key: <introduce key>
```

### Specifying a Custom Key
You can provide a custom 64-byte encryption key using the `-p` flag:
```sh
./woody_woodpacker <target_binary> -p "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```
